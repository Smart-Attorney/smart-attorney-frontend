Firebase api should be run from the backend.
LocalStorage methods are to be replaced by backend database.


firebase file storage is an external service
localstorage acts as mock database

request from client to server
  routehandler <==> controller <==> service <==> dao

 - mockapi sends request from frontend to mockbackend with data
 - routehandler passes data to a controller
 - controller calls service methods
 - services contain all business logic
 - dao retrieves and sends data to database
